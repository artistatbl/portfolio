# Tailwind CSS v4.0: A Revolutionary Performance Leap

Tailwind CSS v4.0 has arrived, and it's nothing short of revolutionary. This all-new version represents a complete ground-up rewrite optimized for performance and flexibility, taking full advantage of the latest web platform advancements.

## Performance That Will Blow Your Mind

The most impressive aspect of v4.0 is its incredible performance improvements:

- **Full builds**: Up to 5x faster
- **Incremental builds**: Over 100x faster (measured in microseconds)
- **No-change rebuilds**: Complete in just 192 microseconds

```bash
# Benchmark comparison
v3.4 Full build: 378ms
v4.0 Full build: 100ms (3.78x improvement)

v3.4 Incremental: 44ms
v4.0 Incremental: 5ms (8.8x improvement)
```

## Built for the Modern Web

Tailwind CSS v4.0 leverages cutting-edge CSS features that weren't available when v3.0 was released:

### Native Cascade Layers
```css
@layer theme, base, components, utilities;

@layer utilities {
  .mx-6 {
    margin-inline: calc(var(--spacing) * 6);
  }
}
```

### Registered Custom Properties
```css
@property --tw-gradient-from {
  syntax: "<color>";
  inherits: false;
  initial-value: #0000;
}
```

### Advanced Color Mixing
```css
.bg-blue-500\/50 {
  background-color: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-blue-500) 50%, transparent);
}
```

## Simplified Installation Experience

Gone are the days of complex configuration. v4.0 streamlines everything:

```bash
# 1. Install Tailwind CSS
npm i tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss

# 2. Add the PostCSS plugin
export default {
  plugins: ["@tailwindcss/postcss"],
};

# 3. Import Tailwind in your CSS
@import "tailwindcss";
```

That's it! No configuration files, no complex setup—just one line of CSS.

## Game-Changing New Features

### CSS-First Configuration
Customize and extend the framework directly in CSS instead of JavaScript:

```css
@theme {
  --color-brand: #3b82f6;
  --font-family-display: "Inter", sans-serif;
}
```

### Container Queries
First-class support for container queries without plugins:

```html
<div class="@container">
  <div class="@lg:grid-cols-2">Content adapts to container size</div>
</div>
```

### 3D Transform Utilities
Transform elements in 3D space directly in your HTML:

```html
<div class="rotate-x-45 rotate-y-12 translate-z-4">
  3D transformed element
</div>
```

### Enhanced Gradient APIs
```html
<!-- Radial gradients -->
<div class="bg-gradient-radial from-blue-500 to-purple-600"></div>

<!-- Conic gradients -->
<div class="bg-gradient-conic from-red-500 via-yellow-500 to-blue-500"></div>
```

### @starting-style Support
Create smooth enter and exit transitions without JavaScript:

```css
.fade-in {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 0.3s;
}

@starting-style {
  .fade-in {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

## Modernized Design System

### P3 Color Palette
Tailwind v4.0 features a redesigned, more vivid color palette that takes full advantage of modern display technology and the P3 color space.

### Dynamic Utility Values
```html
<!-- No more guessing spacing values -->
<div class="p-[theme(spacing.4)]">
<!-- Access theme values directly -->
<div class="bg-[theme(colors.blue.500)]">
```

### not-* Variant
```html
<!-- Style elements when they DON'T match conditions -->
<button class="not-disabled:hover:bg-blue-600">
  Only hover when not disabled
</button>
```
