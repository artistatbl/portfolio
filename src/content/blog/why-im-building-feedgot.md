# Why I'm Building Feedgot

Customer feedback tools are essential, but many are expensive, closed, or limited. I’ve used and evaluated platforms like UserJot, Featurebase, Canny, Nolt, and UserVoice — each has strengths, but none fully match what I want for speed, openness, and affordability.

Feedgot is my answer: an open-source, modern feedback platform designed to be fast, beautiful, and genuinely accessible.

## What is Feedgot?

Feedgot is a customer feedback and content management app that helps you:

- Collect, categorize, and prioritize feedback effortlessly
- Share public roadmaps and changelogs
- Collaborate with your team on decisions
- Close the loop with customers through updates and announcements

It’s built with a modern interface, crisp interactions, and thoughtful defaults — the kind of UX I want to use every day.

## Why open-source and affordable?

I believe teams should own their feedback data and have the freedom to self-host if they want. Feedgot is open-source, with generous free tiers out of the box. For hosted plans, pricing will be about 70% cheaper than comparable tools.

This isn’t a race to the bottom — it’s a commitment to value: powerful features, sane limits, and transparent pricing.

## Alternatives — and what I’m improving

Amazing products exist: UserJot, Featurebase, Canny, Nolt, UserVoice. Feedgot aims to be a strong alternative by focusing on:

- Speed and simplicity over bloat
- First-class tagging, grouping, and prioritization
- Delightful, modern UI
- Open APIs and integrations by default
- OSS-first development and community contributions

## Who should use Feedgot?

- Early-stage founders who want focus and clarity
- Product teams needing lightweight feedback ops
- Open-source maintainers who want public roadmaps and changelogs
- Anyone who values ownership, speed, and great UX

## Roadmap (high-level)

- Feedback boards, voting, and weighted prioritization
- Roadmaps with statuses and timelines
- Release notes and changelog publishing
- Email updates and webhook integrations
- API + SDKs for quick integrations

## Closing thoughts

I’m building Feedgot to be the best open-source customer feedback platform — generous free tiers, modern design, and pricing that respects teams. If you’re interested, reach out or follow along. Feedback about Feedgot is very meta — and very welcome.
